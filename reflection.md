# Reflection

## What Copilot Generated
Copilot helped generate the initial versions of my cleaning functions such as loading the data, cleaning column names, and removing invalid rows. I triggered Copilot by writing comments above each function, and it suggested full function bodies.

## What I Modified
I renamed the functions and variables to be clearer. I also simplified some of Copilot’s logic, especially in the whitespace and missing value functions, so they matched the requirements of the assignment. I removed unnecessary arguments and extra conditions Copilot added.

## What I Learned
I learned how to use Python and pandas to clean messy data using a clear pipeline. I also learned that Copilot is good for speeding up repetitive code, but it sometimes produces code that doesn’t match the project needs, so manual editing is important. This project helped me understand cleaning steps like standardizing column names and removing invalid data.
