# Workout Tracker Project

This project is a simple Python program that asks the user how many minutes they worked out today and then estimates how many minutes they will work out in a full week. The program also includes basic error handling to make sure the user enters a valid number.

## What the Program Does
- Welcomes the user
- Asks: “How many minutes did you work out today?”
- Checks if the input is a valid number
- Multiplies the number by 7 to estimate weekly workout minutes
- Prints the weekly total for the user

## Example
If the user enters:
30

The program prints:
You are on track to work out for 210 minutes this week.

## Error Handling
If the user enters something that is not a number, the program prints:
Please enter a valid number.
